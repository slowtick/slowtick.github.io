Popular Search Engines use crawlers to periodically dowload your website pages and add to their search index. Typically if any of your website page is linked in an already indexed site, the search engine crawlers may find the link to your site and crawl your website as automatically.

For a new website that is not linked elsewhere, manually submitting to Search Engine helps bringing in visitors looking for content via search (organic visitors).

Popular search engines accepting manual submissions include;

| Crawler              | Submission URL                                                                        |
